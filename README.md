### Hi there, Im Megan ðŸ‘‹

An Frontend Web Developer and student based in Indonesia. Every day I am just writing lines of code. Bugs and errors are my best friend. I am curious to learn something new, especially web technology and design. I fall in love with JavaScript and TypeScript.

Not just coding, I also took care of what I wrote. Writing clean code and make me comfortable.
